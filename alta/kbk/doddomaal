Anup was very active in cross team collaborations where he used to organize session for different teams so that they could share knowledge and collaborate better. At present I am pursuing my MBA from MIT Sloan but I was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley heading the Collateral Management Space and  I was invited by Anup to speak about the Collateral Management Systems and since then I got to koow him.  

Since day one I found him very enthisiactic about knowing how things function in an Investment Bank and he used to often interact with me various systems the problems they have discussing new technology trends or sharing ideas. In one such discussion we were speaking about the issues faced introducing self-healing workflows for processing backdated trades on and Order Management System. I was surprized too realized that  after a month he came back with a generic design of processing trade adjustments in an asynchronized and non-blocking. His design incorporated the bitemporal tagging of the events which allowed to time slice the data from business as wells as system perspective. The solution built using Scala,Akka,Angular and Teradata used fucntional design paradiagms to achieve this feature.
